## Python Bottle Framework Scaffold for Google App Engine

A skeleton for building Python applications on Google App Engine with the
[Bottle micro framework](http://bottlepy.org) version 0.11.6

See our other [Google Cloud Platform github
repos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform) for other sample applications.

## Run Locally
1. Install the [App Engine Python SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads).
See the README file for directions. You'll need python 2.7 and [pip 1.4 or later](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) installed too.

2. Clone this repository with

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-python-bottle-skeleton.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies in the project's lib/ directory - App Engine
   can only import libraries from inside your project directory.

   ```
   cd appengine-python-bottle-skeleton
   pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib/
   ```
4. Run this project locally from the command line:

   ```
   dev_appserver.py <projectDirectory>
   ```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

See [the development server documentation](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver)
for options when running dev_appserver.

## Deploy
To deploy the application:

1. Use the [Admin Console](https://appengine.google.com) to create an app and
   get the project/app id. (App id and project id are identical)
1. [Deploy the
   application](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadinganapp) with

```
appcfg.py -A <your-project-id> --oauth2 update <projectDirectory>
```
1. Congratulations! Your application is now live at your-project-id.appspot.com

## Next Steps
This skeleton includes TODO markers you can search for to determine some of the
basic areas you will want to customize.

### Relational Databases and Datastore
To add persistence to your models, use
[NDB](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/) for
scale.  Consider
[CloudSQL](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql) if you need a
relational database.

### Installing Libraries
See the [Third party
libraries](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27)
page for libraries that are already included in the SDK.  To include SDK
libraries, add them in your app.yaml file. All other libraries must be included
in your project directory in order to be used by App Engine.  Only pure python
libraries may be added to an App Engine project.
